SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in Scotlandâ€™s wastewater

Nationwide, wastewater based monitoring was newly established in Scotland to track the levels of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA shed into the sewage network, during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Viral levels were analysed by RT-qPCR assays of the N1 gene, on RNA extracted from wastewater sampled at 122 locations. 

These wastewater data are contributing to estimates of disease prevalence and the viral reproduction number (R) in Scotland and in the UK.

This is a branch with github pages for the project dashboard: [COVID Wastewater Scotland](https://biordm.github.io/COVID-Wastewater-Scotland/), which contains the details of methodology for viral quantification and data analysis.

The main branch contains the data files with SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels and scripts for data transformations and visualizations.
