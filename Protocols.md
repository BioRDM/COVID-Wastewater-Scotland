# Protocols
The protocols developed during these projects aiming to stablish methodologies for the detection 
of SARS-CoV-2 and its new variants in wastewater are published in the public protocol platform [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io).

## RT-qPCR for detection of SARS-Cov2 in wastewater

Viral RNA is extracted from a known volume of STW influent and amplified by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)

RT-qPCR is a process whereby RNA is first converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) after which it can undergo amplification and quantification via PCR. The amplification of a non-target sequence, in this case the Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), can also be carried out to act as an internal control.

This procedure outlines the method for amplification and quantification of the RNA extracted from Crude Sewage samples but could equally apply to other RNA extracted from other types of environmental sample.

## SARS-Cov2 RNA extraction from wastewater

This procedure outlines the method for wastewater sample preparation, concentration of viral RNA in wastewater, and viral RNA extraction from using QIAamp Viral RNA kit. This procedure works also with all types of environmental and potable water samples.
In this method, a known volume of sample is concentrated using a centrifugal filter to allow for the extraction and detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

As an analytical control, samples are spiked with a known quantity of non-target RNA (PRRS1) at the start of the process to demonstrate that the method has been successful at concentrating and recovering RNA particles.
